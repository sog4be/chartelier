## Why chartelier?

Most visualizations unintentionally mislead—often without anyone noticing. Good tools exist, but only reach those who already value accuracy.

Now, AI agents generate visualizations at scale, but they do so blindly. LLMs can't "see" what they create, resulting in subtle but significant errors.

`chartelier` doesn't make LLMs do more—it makes them do less. We restrict their role to what they're best at, constraining choices to a finite, validated space. No arbitrary code, no guesswork, just clarity.

Users get reliable visualizations by default, without even thinking about it. The way it always should have been.

## üéØ Objective

Bring the working tree to a green state by:
1. **Formatting** with Ruff formatter
2. **Auto-fixing** lints (safe rules) with Ruff
3. **Lint checking** (Ruff)
4. **Type checking** with MyPy (strict per pyproject)
5. **Unit tests** via Pytest/Tox

If MyPy/Pytest fail, propose **minimal diffs**; apply them only when safe and re-run.

## üì¶ Repository Facts

* Python: **3.11** (`.python-version`)
* Tooling: **uv/tox/ruff/mypy/pytest already configured** (no installation required)
* Tox envs: `py{311,312,313}`, `lint`, `type`, `coverage`, `format`

## üß∞ Commands (Fixed to **uv run**)

All commands are executed with `uv run`. No environment setup or bootstrapping required.

```bash
# (Optional) Version display
uv run python -V
uv run ruff --version
uv run mypy --version
uv run pytest --version
uv run tox --version

# 1) Format & auto-fix (Ruff)
uv run ruff check --fix src tests
uv run ruff format src tests

# 2) Lint gate (Tox‚ÜíRuff)
uv run tox -e lint

# 3) Type check (Tox‚ÜíMyPy)
uv run tox -e type
# Direct call if needed (reference):
# uv run mypy src

# 4) Tests (Py311 preferred)
uv run tox -e py311 || uv run pytest

# 5) Coverage (optional)
uv run tox -e coverage
```

## üßØ Ruff/MyPy Ignore Policy (Minimal & Justified)

**Conclusion**: For cases where rules are excessive and "not fixing is safer/clearer", we allow **line-level** `noqa` / `type: ignore[...]` or pinpoint adjustments in `pyproject.toml`. However, **the default is to fix the code**. Unlimited global disabling is not permitted.

### Principles (in order of priority)

1. **Fix the code first** (naming, remove unused imports, add type annotations, narrow with `cast`/`assert isinstance`, etc.)
2. **Line-level suppression** takes highest priority:
   * Ruff: `# noqa: <RULE> ‚Äî reason (brief in English)`
   * MyPy: `# type: ignore[<error-code>] ‚Äî reason` (**bare** `type: ignore` is prohibited)
3. **Same rule recurring across multiple files** ‚Üí Consider **local settings** in `pyproject.toml` (**per-file-ignores** / **overrides**)
4. **Global disabling is a last resort**. Only when project policy and rationale are clear, with review consensus.

### Easily Acceptable Cases

* **False positives/third-party issues** (incomplete type stubs, dynamic attributes, generated code constraints)
* **Readability significantly harmed by workarounds** (e.g., very long URLs with E501)
* **Test convenience** (magic numbers, `print`-based smoke tests, etc.)

### Cautious/Prohibited in Principle

* **Bulk disabling of security-related rules (Ruff `S‚Ä¶`) in src**. Prioritize line-level or root cause fixes.
* **Globally** disabling **bug-prone rules** (e.g., permanently ignoring unused variables/unused imports across the entire codebase).

### Implementation Guide

**Line-level (recommended)**

```python
# Ruff
URL = "https://example.com/really/long/path?..."  # noqa: E501 ‚Äî Long URLs are more readable unwrapped

# MyPy (third-party without types)
import thirdparty
thirdparty.do_something()  # type: ignore[no-redef] ‚Äî No type stubs provided, behavior tested
```

**File/Directory-level (when recurring)** ‚Äî `pyproject.toml`

```toml
[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]
"src/chartelier/interfaces/mcp/server.py" = ["D", "T201"] # CLI entry allows concise docstrings/print

[[tool.mypy.overrides]]
module = ["thirdparty.*"]
ignore_missing_imports = true
```

First use **per-file-ignores** / **overrides**, **avoid global disabling in [tool.ruff.lint.ignore]**.

### Operational Standards

* When adding new `noqa` for the same `RULE` in **3+ locations**, consider **local adjustment in pyproject** (per-file / specific directory)
* Include **reason and removal conditions** with `noqa` / `type: ignore[...]` (e.g., `TODO(#123): Remove after type stub update`)
* Document **list of added ignores** (RULE/count/reason) in PR summary

### Consistency with Existing Settings

* This repository already has some Ruff/Mypy rules in `ignore`/`per-file-ignores`. **Align similar exceptions with existing policy** and **don't unnecessarily broaden scope**.

## üîÅ Default Workflow

1. **Format+fix** ‚Üí **Lint** ‚Üí **Type** ‚Üí **Pytest** (all with `uv run`)
2. On failure, apply **minimal fixes** and re-run
3. Don't commit until user instructs

## üß™ Quick Health Check (read-only)

```bash
uv run tox -e lint && uv run tox -e type && uv run tox -e py311
```
